// Write a loop that logs the squares of numbers from 1 to 10, but displays the result only if it is less than 50.

// Tip: Use an IF condition to check and see if the result of the calculation is below the required amount.

let square = 0;
for (let i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
    if ((square = i * i) < 50) {
    console.log(square);
    }
}
