// Write a loop that counts backwards from 10 to 1 and logs each number to the console.

// Tip: The "--" works just like the "++" operator, but it subtracts one instead of adding one.

// Stretch goal: Write both a FOR loop version and a WHILE loop version.

    console.log(i);

let j = 10
while (j > 0) {
