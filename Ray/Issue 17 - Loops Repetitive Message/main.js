// Write a loop that simply outputs a string 4 times in succession (one line after the next). The message is up to you, but keep it short to fit on one line.

// For practice, complete this exercise with both a FOR loop and with a WHILE loop.

for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {console.log('text')};

let i = 0
while (i < 4) {console.log('more text'); i++;}
